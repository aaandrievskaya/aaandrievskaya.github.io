On its basis, the supervisor analyzes the quality of the performance of the essay, term paper or thesis and evaluates: how deeply the relevance of the topic is realized and understood, whether the goal has been achieved, whether the research methods have been chosen correctly and whether they have been used correctly, etc.</p>
<p>The composition of the Introduction is a description of the scientific apparatus, which depends on what kind of work is being done. If an abstract is being written, then the Introduction will describe the relevance of the topic, the purpose of the abstract, the subject and methods of research. If this is a term paper, then the Introduction, in addition to those components that are included in the abstract, will also include a description of the object and objectives of the study. The thesis describes the entire scientific apparatus. So the student, from work to work, gradually masters the technology of designing scientific research in forms accessible to him.</p>
<p>The volume of the Introduction is approximately 1/10 of the entire volume of the work, that is, the specific text of the abstract, term paper or thesis. Place of Introduction - it is located immediately after the Table of Contents before the main part.</p>
<p>Requirements for writing an Introduction:</p>
<p>a) Introduction is printed on separate pages;</p>
<p>b) it is not numbered either in the Table of Contents or in the text, but goes as an independent part of the work;</p>
<p>c) all components of the scientific apparatus are highlighted in type or underlined;</p>
<p>d) each component is written from a new line.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>The relevance of the study is determined by the fact that &hellip;;</p>
<p>The purpose of the study is to develop a set of methods &hellip;;</p>
<p>The subject of the study is the methods of educating observation&hellip;</p>
<p>When writing the Introduction, we recommend paying special attention to the relevance of the research topic. This is, in fact, a patent research work to find a state or regional order for your topic, to determine the place of the topic in the scientific world, in relation to practice.</p>
<p>Be vigilant - reading the Introduction begins the evaluation of your work. Everyone reads the introduction, especially opponents. By its quality, they judge all the work, the level of professional training, responsibility, the ability to design their work and carry it out thoughtfully, and many other qualities of a specialist.</p>
<h2 id="the-main-part">The main part</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The main part&rdquo; is the conditional name of the description of the entire study, that is, the substantive part of the abstract, term paper or thesis. This is what is being built on the basis of the designed scientific apparatus. Here everything should be subordinated to the achievement of the goal of transforming the subject of research by the methods you have chosen. Everything that was designed and described in the Introduction begins to &ldquo;work&rdquo; here.</p>
<p>To write the main part, a text plan is drawn up as a list of the main provisions to be disclosed. Any plan of written text consists of chapters, paragraphs and subparagraphs. Their number depends on the amount of material and the nature of the text, the characteristics of the academic discipline, within and on the basis of which the work is performed. The general requirement is that they be proportional to each other in terms of volume and degree of complexity of the content. In addition, the number of paragraphs in chapters and subparagraphs in paragraphs must certainly be at least two. A chapter cannot consist of one paragraph, and a paragraph of one subparagraph.</p>
<p>The titles (titles) of chapters, paragraphs and subparagraphs may not coincide with each other or with the topic. The words &ldquo;Main part&rdquo; are not included in any of the headings, since this is the conditional name of the entire text according to its purpose in the work. The titles of all chapters, paragraphs and subparagraphs are constructed meaningfully, reflecting the ideas disclosed in them. Their purpose is to direct the attention of both the writer and the reader to a specific idea, specific material.</p>
<p>The construction of the main part of the abstract depends on its volume, content features and the goal. Most often, the abstract has no chapters, but only paragraphs without further division into subparagraphs. The abstract may not have any division into parts at all, but be performed as a holistic work, but with the internal logic of presenting the content. The paragraphs highlighted in the abstract do not have a common heading, such for them is the topic of the abstract, which is on the title page.</p>
<p>The construction of the main part of the course work in more detail than the abstract. It contains at least two chapters. The chapters are divided into paragraphs. Subparagraphs are almost never used here. Each chapter has its own meaningful title, as does each paragraph. If the content of the chapters cannot be divided into paragraphs, then the chapters are simplified to paragraphs, that is, they are not introduced at all. As a rule, term papers are divided into two chapters - theoretical and empirical, devoted either to generalization of work experience or a small experiment. It is possible to write a term paper only on theoretical or only on empirical material. It depends on the topic, on the goals and objectives, as well as on the supervisor. Recall that the theoretical part of the work cannot bear such names as &ldquo;Main Part&rdquo;, &ldquo;Theoretical Part&rdquo; or &ldquo;Literature Review&rdquo;. Its headings are formulated in a meaningful, problematic way in accordance with a specific topic and methods of working on a theory.</p>
<p>The construction of the main part of the thesis is even more complex. The thesis work may consist of more chapters, for example, four. The first chapter, as a rule, is devoted to theoretical issues, the second - to the description of the experiment program, the third - to conducting the experiment and discussing its results, the fourth - to the development of methodological recommendations. A combination of the second and third chapters is possible. Perhaps the absence of the fourth chapter. Everything depends again on the characteristics of the topic, goals and objectives, the chosen methods and recommendations of the supervisor.</p>
<p>In the thesis work, each chapter ends with a special section that does not have its own numbering, namely - Conclusions on the chapter. These conclusions summarize the material presented in the paragraphs of the chapter and allow one to obtain new conclusions that are different from those already known in science, or to confirm them on new research material. Chapter conclusions are a sequence of statements consisting of premises and previously proven statements. This respects the logical law of sufficient reason, according to which every judgment must be justified by others, the truth of which has been proven by you or someone else. Chapter inferences can be drawn inductively and deductively. Requirements for conclusions by chapters: consistency, compliance with the content of the chapter and novelty.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Each study has a Conclusion as an epilogue of the work, as its final part. The purpose of the Conclusion is to show that the goal set for the study has been achieved, and the hypothesis has been proven.</p>
<p>Types of Conclusion: summary, conclusions and conclusion itself. A summary is a brief description of the work done, performed as a list of what has been done and conclusions by chapter. Most often used in referencing. Conclusions are already new judgments, or rather conclusions made on the material of theory or empiricism. In the conclusions, theoretical or empirical material serves only as a basis for new ideas, judgments, provisions, recommendations. Most often, conclusions are drawn where the authors of the papers have their own judgments and apply various methods of analyzing scientific papers and practice. The conclusion is a complex form of completing the study, which includes both a summary and conclusions. In addition, the Conclusion includes an assessment of the theoretical and practical significance of the work, which may go beyond the topic.</p>
<p>The choice of the type of Conclusion depends on:</p>
<p>the complexity of the work (for an abstract, a summary is enough, for a term paper - conclusions, and for a diploma - a conclusion);
on the nature of the content of the work, that is, on what methods of working with it were used: the more complex the methods and the less compiling work, the more expedient it is to choose conclusions and even a conclusion;
the author&rsquo;s possession of the technology for performing these types of completion of his research.
The construction of the Conclusion depends on the selected view. In its most complete form, it is built approximately according to this plan:</p>
<p>statement about the achievement of the purpose of the study and evidence;
hypotheses with brief confirmations;
summary as the shortest overview of the work done;
new provisions (ideas, judgments, assessments) obtained as a result of the study;
determination of the scientific novelty of the work done;
determination of the practical significance of the work done.
According to the style of writing The conclusion should be concise, clear, logical, evidence-based, convincing. It must be remembered that both the supervisor and opponents who give feedback on the work are most attentive to it, as well as to the Introduction.</p>
<p>The volume of the Conclusion is determined by the nature of the work. But there is a conditional standard. Like the Introduction, it is given no more than 1/10 of the entire text.</p>
<h2 id="list-of-sources-used">List of sources used</h2>
<p>The list of references completes the description of the study. Often it is called the Bibliography, which is not correct. The list of references follows the Conclusion and is drawn up from a new page.</p>
<p>The amount of literature included in the List depends on the form of research work. For an abstract, the standard is at least 5 works, for a term paper - at least 10, for a thesis - at least 25.</p>
<p>The literature included in the List is published theoretical sources, legal documents, as well as archival materials. Handwritten materials with the indication &ldquo;Manuscript&rdquo; can be entered here. Not only cited literature is included, but also read literature that is directly related to the topic under study. All authors and their works indicated in the text should be included in this list, especially cited works.</p>
<p>The List of References should include works on the study of your topic by teachers, psychologists, sociologists, historians, philosophers and other specialists working at your university. You are called to contribute to the development of science in your alma mater.</p>
<p>All literature is drawn up strictly in alphabetical order, according to the first letter of the author&rsquo;s last name or the first letter of the title of a document or collective work that does not have a strict authorship. Each work is assigned its own serial number, which is then referenced in the text of the work when citing.</p>
<p>Each source included in the List of References has a specific design. In addition to the author&rsquo;s name and the title of the work, the output data is indicated. They include: the place of publication, the name of the publisher or organization that published the work, and the year of publication. In addition, the number of pages in the text is indicated.</p>
<p>Literature is drawn up strictly taking into account the requirements of GOST.</p>
<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>
<p>The appendix is ​​a material that clarifies, illustrates, confirms certain provisions of your study and is not included in the text of the main part. It has a complementary meaning. The application, as a rule, is used in theses and rarely in abstracts and term papers, its composition is determined by the researcher&rsquo;s intention.</p>
<p>Types of Applications: copies of plans and programs, photographs, texts of tests and questionnaires, samples of children&rsquo;s drawings and essays, reports, reports, documents or extracts from them, charters, regulations, etc.</p>
<p>As a rule, Applications are made only if there are at least two of them. For one Application, it is not entered. Each Appendix cannot be more than five pages long.</p>
<p>Only those materials that are referenced in the Main Text are included in the Appendix. Communication of the main text and the Appendix is ​​obligatory.</p>
<p>Each Appendix has its own number (without indicating the sign No.), is placed at the end of the work with the continuation of the general page numbering. Applications are arranged in order of reference to them in the text of the work (see any Appendix of this book).</p>
<p>Each Application is issued separately. In the right corner of the first page it is written: &ldquo;Appendix 1&rdquo;, &ldquo;Appendix 2&rdquo;, etc.</p>
<p>Statistical tables, diagrams of experiments are not included in the Appendix, they are included directly in the text.</p>
<p>Application material is not included in the scope of work. Each Appendix is ​​entered in the Table of Contents under its own number and with its own name.</p>
<p>The total volume of the Appendix should not exceed one third of the volume of the entire text of the work.</p>
