      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-life-will-pass---you-will-not-notice&#34;&gt;So life will pass - you will not notice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I report on the condition of my leg :) It is already healing, I am starting to walk again, although I am afraid (what if, due to stress, it will become inflamed again?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday I will be discharged, which I am incredibly happy about. Finally, my torment will end. I will be able to take a walk in the fresh air, I will be able to start exercising, I will be able to go to all the extra classes that I have not yet attended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, about this. On May 19, a vocal reporting concert was held, in which I could not take part, although I really wanted to. Words cannot describe how frustrating it is when you spent so much time preparing to present your creative work, but due to circumstances you cannot afford it. In fact, I could take a chance and perform, but there was a high probability of injuring my ankle again and I decided not to risk it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I hope that very soon my life will cease to be like Groundhog Day and I will again be a full-fledged person with an interesting life)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Holidays at home</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-couldnt-imagine-that&#34;&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t imagine that&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you everything in order.
My ankle has already begun to heal. I was already able to walk on my own, even go outside to the store. &amp;ldquo;How happy I am,&amp;rdquo; I thought to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how most of the week went. I really wanted to go to the parade dedicated to the Victory Day. and prst go for a walk on the May holidays, but I didn’t allow myself this, because I wasn’t completely healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The discharge is on Friday, from Monday I will finally be a full-fledged person,” I dreamed to myself. But my plans were not destined to come true, my leg began to hurt again, I again cannot afford to walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday my doctor was very angry. He believes that I do not want to recover, so I deliberately loaded my leg and prolonged the illness. But that&amp;rsquo;s not true, I really didn&amp;rsquo;t think that I could damage the healed ligaments if I walked a little. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even get hurt&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sick leave has been extended for another 10 days, and I&amp;rsquo;m sitting at home, as if in prison. Although, perhaps this is for the best, because I had a lot of time to watch all the series and go through all the games that I left for the holidays&amp;hellip; :)&lt;/p&gt;
