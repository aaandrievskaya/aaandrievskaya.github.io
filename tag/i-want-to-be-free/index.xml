      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-couldnt-imagine-that&#34;&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t imagine that&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you everything in order.
My ankle has already begun to heal. I was already able to walk on my own, even go outside to the store. &amp;ldquo;How happy I am,&amp;rdquo; I thought to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how most of the week went. I really wanted to go to the parade dedicated to the Victory Day. and prst go for a walk on the May holidays, but I didn’t allow myself this, because I wasn’t completely healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The discharge is on Friday, from Monday I will finally be a full-fledged person,” I dreamed to myself. But my plans were not destined to come true, my leg began to hurt again, I again cannot afford to walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday my doctor was very angry. He believes that I do not want to recover, so I deliberately loaded my leg and prolonged the illness. But that&amp;rsquo;s not true, I really didn&amp;rsquo;t think that I could damage the healed ligaments if I walked a little. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even get hurt&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sick leave has been extended for another 10 days, and I&amp;rsquo;m sitting at home, as if in prison. Although, perhaps this is for the best, because I had a lot of time to watch all the series and go through all the games that I left for the holidays&amp;hellip; :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-social-networks&#34;&gt;My social networks&lt;/h2&gt;
