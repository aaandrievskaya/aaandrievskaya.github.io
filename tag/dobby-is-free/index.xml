      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-busy-week&#34;&gt;My busy week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, as you already understood, I was discharged) I am again a full-fledged person of society! Almost&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is that my leg has not fully healed, I still limp a lot. The doctor warned that the sprain could take a really long time to heal and I calmed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, now that I&amp;rsquo;m no longer at home, I have more to share with you! I attended OS pairs on Thursday and English on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, I passed my debt on the report on the topic &amp;ldquo;User authentication scheme using logins and passwords.&amp;rdquo; Ironically, on that day, scammers hacked into my Vkontakte account. It was a sad but priceless experience. After all, even knowing the whole theory of Internet security, I was still caught with the help of social engineering on a phishing link. Therefore, I urge you all to once again remember the safety rules and rational thinking. Don&amp;rsquo;t repeat my mistakes!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, I was glad to see the guys I sat down to miss so much. Unfortunately, there are a lot of debts in English that I have to complete in a week. But this is partly my fault, since I could do some tasks at home, but instead I decided to take a little vacation for myself &amp;hellip; Although, I donâ€™t regret anything :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s where I&amp;rsquo;ll end my report. See you in a week!&lt;/p&gt;
