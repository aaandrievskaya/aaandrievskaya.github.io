My ankle has already begun to heal. I was already able to walk on my own, even go outside to the store. “How happy I am,” I thought to myself.\nThis is how most of the week went. I really wanted to go to the parade dedicated to the Victory Day. and prst go for a walk on the May holidays, but I didn’t allow myself this, because I wasn’t completely healthy.\n“The discharge is on Friday, from Monday I will finally be a full-fledged person,” I dreamed to myself. But my plans were not destined to come true, my leg began to hurt again, I again cannot afford to walk.\nOn Friday my doctor was very angry. He believes that I do not want to recover, so I deliberately loaded my leg and prolonged the illness. But that’s not true, I really didn’t think that I could damage the healed ligaments if I walked a little. I didn’t even get hurt…\nMy sick leave has been extended for another 10 days, and I’m sitting at home, as if in prison. Although, perhaps this is for the best, because I had a lot of time to watch all the series and go through all the games that I left for the holidays… :)\nMy social networks  VK Instagram  ","date":1652486400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652486400,"objectID":"487c0ec09fc20b79a0dfd0835848e4bf","permalink":"https://aaandrievskaya.github.io/post/how-was-my-week-2/","publishdate":"2022-05-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/how-was-my-week-2/","section":"post","summary":"If you follow my blog you know what happened to my leg last week.

It allows you to add basic formatting to text using characters known and available on all keyboards. Font size, color, and other advanced options are not available in Markdown.\nMarkdown Syntax This is a quick reference to the basic elements of Markdown syntax. There is no single standard, and different versions of Markdown may differ in details. But the basic elements from the list below are supported in all standards.\nText selection This text will be italicized This text will be italic (italic)\nThis text will be bold This text will be bold\nYou can insert one type into another\nTitles ‘# This is the largest heading, it turns into an  tag ‘##  ‘###  ‘####  ‘#####  ‘###### \nIn Markdown, headings are written without the symbol \u0026#39;\nLinks https://hexlet.io - the text of a simple link will become a clickable link automatically You can make any text a link:\nThis is a Hexlet link\nQuote  That’s a wise quote wise man.\n Pictures    The code To highlight code (or any unformatted text), special characters are used - back ticks: `\nSometimes you need to add a piece of code function(12); to a regular line of text.

On Wednesday, I was in a hurry to go home, as it was already quite late. I stumbled and twisted my leg. It didn’t hurt me and at that moment I didn’t attach any importance to it. However, already on Friday, the leg was very swollen and it was impossible to walk. I had to go to the emergency room and explain the situation. Of course, there was no talk of attending a university. I was issued a sick leave and now I’m staying at home, away from all the interesting events…\nHowever, perhaps this is for the best. During this time, I will miss all my friends enough and it will be doubly joyful to see them again!

General concepts Version control systems (VCS) are used when several people work on the same project. Usually the main project tree is stored in the local or a remote repository to which access is configured for project members. At making changes to the content of the project, the version control system allows them to fix, combine changes made by different project participants, rollback to any earlier version of the project, if required. Classical version control systems use a centralized model, assuming a single repository for storing files. Most of the version control functions are performed by a dedicated server. The project participant (user) before starting work through certain command gets the version of files it needs. After making changes, the user commits the new version to the repository. This does not remove previous versions. from the central repository and you can return to them at any time. The server can save not the full version of the changed files, but produce the so-called delta compression - save only changes between successive versions, which allows you to reduce the amount of stored data. Version control systems support traceability and resolution conflicts that may arise when several people work on one file. You can merge (merge) the changes made by different participants (automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, undo the changes altogether or lock files for modification. Depending on the settings, blocking is not allows other users to get a working copy or prevents modification working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file. Version control systems can also provide additional, more flexible functionality. For example, they can support working with multiple versions of the same file, keeping a common history of changes up to the branch point. versions and each branch’s own change histories. In addition, it is usually available information about which of the participants, when and what changes were made. Usually this kind of information is stored in the change log, access to which can be restricted. Unlike classical ones, in distributed version control systems, the central the repository is optional. Among the classic VCS, CVS, Subversion are the most famous, and among the distributed ones - Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. The principles of their work are similar, they differ mainly the syntax of the commands used in the work.\nBasic git commands The most commonly used git commands are: – creating the main repository tree:\n1 git init\n– receiving updates (changes) of the current tree from the central repository:\n1 git pull\n– sending all the changes made to the local tree to the central repository:\n1 git push\n– view the list of changed files in the current directory:\n1 git status\n– view current changes:\n1 git diff\n– saving current changes: – add all modified and/or created files and/or directories:\n1 git add .\n– add specific modified and/or created files and/or directories:\n1 git add filenames\n– delete a file and/or directory from the repository index (in this case, the file and/or directory remains in the local directory):\n1 git rm filenames\n– saving the added changes: – save all added changes and all modified files:\n1 git commit -am ‘Commit description’\n save the added changes with a comment through the built-in editor:  1 git commit\n– creating a new branch based on the current one:\n1 git checkout -b branchname\n switch to some branch:  1 git checkout branch_name\n(when you switch to a branch that is not yet in the local repository, it will be created and linked to the remote) – pushing changes of a specific branch to the central repository:\n1 git push origin branchname\n– merge the branch with the current tree:\n1 git merge –no-ff branchname\n deleting a branch: – deleting a local branch already merged with the main tree:  1 git branch -d branchname\n forced deletion of the local branch:  1 git branch -D branchname\n– deleting a branch from the central repository:\n1 git push origin :branchname\nStandard Operating Procedures for a Central Repository The work of the user with his branch begins with checking and receiving changes from the central repository (at the same time, to the local tree before starting this procedure should not be changed):\n1 git checkout master 2 git-pull 3 git checkout -b branchname\nYou can then make changes in the local tree and/or branch. After the completion of making some change to the files and / or directories of the project you need to place them in the central repository. To do this, you need to check, which files have changed so far:\n1 git status\nand, if necessary, delete unnecessary files that we do not want to send to the central repository. Then it is useful to review the text of the changes for compliance with the rules for maintaining clean commits:\n1 git diff\nIf some files should not be included in the commit, then we mark only those …","date":1651881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651881600,"objectID":"97164bfe184b400c3adb26bd96db98ad","permalink":"https://aaandrievskaya.github.io/post/version-control.-git/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/version-control.-git/","section":"post","summary":"We will study the ideology and application of version control tools.
