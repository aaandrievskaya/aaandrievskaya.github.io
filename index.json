Phishing is a type of Internet fraud, the purpose of which is to obtain confidential user data from themselves. This includes stealing passwords, credit card numbers, bank accounts, and other sensitive information. Phishers are interested in data that gives direct access to money, as well as personal information of users that helps to make phishing emails credible.\nTypes of phishing lures Domain forgery or familiar user imitation - the message may come from an address of a sender you know or a trusted organization that differs from the original in some subtle detail or character (exapmle@mail.com instead of example@mail.com, supportonline@mail.com instead support.online@mail.com).\nText honeypots - A text message that comes from a supposedly trusted source, such as a bank, government agency, or commercial company. The message asks the user to provide personal information (username, password, or sensitive financial data). Examine the letter carefully if the information is required “urgently” or “as soon as possible” - this is one of the signs of a phishing letter.\nPhishing Links - The email message contains a link to a page similar to the authorization page of a trusted site and urging, for example, to urgently change the password. With this action, you can put it directly into the hands of attackers.\nPhishing attachments - an email message contains a malicious file and an invitation to open it.\nFake Cloud Storage Links - An email purporting to be from a trusted source prompts the user to grant permission and/or enter personal information such as credentials in exchange for access to a fake cloud storage location.\nProtection methods The main principle: do nothing automatically, mindlessly. The familiar look of an e-mail should not allow the addressee to perform a standard action without reading it carefully. Be vigilant: is everything in order with addresses, signatures? Does the letter contain suspicious attachments and an open call to open them? Beware of messages threatening to block your accounts and offers to follow “rescue” links to restore access. Remember that there is a list of data that a particular service is not entitled to request from you - it is better to check with the support specialists of each specific organization. At the same time, some services have data that attackers may not have, such as your first and last name. Therefore, if you receive a non-personalized letter, this is another reason to think about who sent it.\nIf you have any kind of doubt, you need to contact the sending company itself (by a separate letter or by phone) and check the authenticity of the message\nIf possible, refuse to go to trusted resources through hyperlinks from messages sent by unknown senders\nRemember that even the mention of personal information that at first glance is inaccessible to scammers (for example, addressing by name) does not guarantee complete security. Attackers often do preparatory work by getting information about the victim from social networks.\nIn the modern world, passwords cannot provide the necessary protection, especially when users use easy-to-remember combinations that make it easier for hackers to crack, as well as a single password for all services and applications, thereby increasing the damage from compromise. It is important to strengthen security with multi-factor authentication (verification through multiple channels). Moving to multi-factor authentication eliminates 99% of credential theft attacks. It is important to note that SMS one-time codes used as a second factor can also be compromised: SMS verification is only marginally more secure than simple passwords. Now large market players have begun to offer multi-factor authentication using special applications that use codes or biometrics (fingerprint or face), and some - the ability to completely abandon passwords, which radically reduces the likelihood of a successful phishing attack.\nPay attention to the browser warning about suspicious sites - you should definitely not open such Modern mail services also take care of user safety by creating special “sandboxes” for checking suspicious messages in an isolated container and do not “release” information into the system until there is confidence in the security. Listen to the recommendations and report phishing incidents to your mail agent (Microsoft Outlook users can do this using the Send Report button).\nThere are special groups (PhishTank) that collect entire databases of phishing addresses where you can check the incoming message.\n","date":1654300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654300800,"objectID":"d9b06acae785f4775d1f937ea89d42e3","permalink":"https://aaandrievskaya.github.io/post/phishing/","publishdate":"2022-06-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/phishing/","section":"post","summary":"Learn how to protect yourself from phishing scammers who steal user data on the Internet","tags":["Protect","Phishing"],"title":"Phishing","type":"post"},{"authors":["Andrievskaya Anastasiya Andreevna","Andrievskaya A.A."],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"My busy week First of all, as you already understood, I was discharged) I am again a full-fledged person of society!

Such tools are necessary for downloading programs and data, uploading the results obtained, storing huge amounts of information, correcting computer operation by the user, as well as for direct control of production processes and objects. All these functions are assigned to a variety of peripheral devices (PU), which serve to transform the ways of presenting information suitable for a person and used in a computer, to control input / output and organize information storage, regardless of the presence of power.\nThus, I consider it important to systematize and structure information about the peripheral devices of computers, and then determine the significance of the place of peripheral devices in electronic computers.\n1. Interaction of PU and computer 1.1 Definition of peripherals Peripheral, or external, devices got their name in the 1960s, when the processor and RAM were placed in rack cabinets, forming a kind of “center”, and the rest of the devices, mostly electromechanical, were at some distance from it, i.e. on the periphery. But modern PUs are located both inside the computer case and outside, depending on the type of device and its interaction with objects in the outside world. A peripheral device is an additional auxiliary device external to the central processor and main memory, designed to input and / or output information to a computer and store data, and expanding its functionality. That is, it is by and large an optional device for the operation of a computer, but in most cases it is necessary for the implementation of certain user tasks. There are four types of peripherals:\n input devices; output devices; input-output devices; data storage devices. Some PUs, called internal, are mounted in the same case with the computer (for example, hard disk, sound card, network card), while others, called external, are outside the case (for example, keyboard, mouse, printer) and are connected to it using a wired or wireless connection. Peripherals are connected to the central part of the computer through an interface, so it is important to give several definitions of this important concept.  1.2 Interface Interface (interface) - a set of tools and rules that ensure the interaction of devices of a computer or information processing system and (or) programs. In addition to these standard definitions, it is convenient to use one more that expands and refines the above. An interface is a set of means and rules that provide interaction:\n between different nodes of a computer system (hardware interface); between programs (software interface); between hardware and software (hardware and software interface); between a person and a computer (human-machine interface).  Peripheral devices with such a type of human-machine interface as the USB HID class seem to be very promising for use. USB HID is a class of USB devices that connect to a computer for human interaction. This class includes devices such as keyboard, mouse, game controller.\n1.3 Tires So, to connect a peripheral device, you must first provide a hardware interface. In a computer, it is implemented by I / O buses. Modern computers contain two types of buses: a) the system bus that connects the central processing unit to the main memory; b) multiple I/O buses connecting various peripherals to the system bus and processor via a bridge The bus is a subsystem for transmitting data both internally computer and beyond. Unlike a point-to-point connection, which is designed to connect only two devices, a bus, by using the same set of wires, can provide a logical connection for several peripheral devices. The main difference between peripherals is the way they are connected - internal or external. The first is implemented using internal buses, represented by internal connectors (slots) on the system board, the second method is implemented by external buses, represented by external connectors (ports). However, in the general case, an external peripheral device connection scheme is used.\nNext, we should recall the need for a hardware-software interface, i.e. peripheral controller driver.\n1.4 Drivers Driver is a computer software with the help of which another software (operating system) gains access to the hardware of some, in our case, peripheral device. Typically, operating systems ship with drivers for key hardware components that the system cannot function without. However, some devices (such as a video card or printer) may require special drivers, usually provided by the device manufacturer.\n2. Types of peripherals 2.1 Input devices Input devices are those devices through which information can be entered into a computer. Their main purpose is to implement the impact on the PC. The variety of input devices produced has given rise to entire technologies: from tactile to voice.

It is distinguished from other types of programming by the extreme correctness and stability of the final product, the strict separation of scientific and interface parts, the individuality of algorithms, and the predominance of efficiency over universality.\nScientific programming is at the heart of any modern global research. All advanced technologies - from quantum computers to space programs - would not be possible without scientific programmers who can provide scientists with a reliable and accurate tool for making discoveries.\nA number of branches of science directly depend on the level of development of scientific programming. So, unmanned vehicles, “smart” management systems for urban and agricultural management, stock exchanges are waiting for their implementation; waiting for robotics, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence beyond human capabilities\n##Specializations\nScientists use various programming languages, the choice of which depends on the type of problem and the preferences of the author. Historically, the first high-level programming language is Fortran; many debugged libraries of mathematical statistics and libraries for solving differential equations are written on it, which is relevant for economics and biology, respectively.\nPython has a simpler syntax, which is also suitable for programming mathematical calculations. The Python language is used for data processing in mathematics, physics, economics, biology, chemistry and can work with some other “scientific” languages: Fortran, C++, C#.\nIn turn, C# allows you to program on the .NET platform, adapt the program to the common language runtime (CLR), and accelerate development within the framework of operational scientific sessions.\nThe future of the programmer-scientist profession Programming drives science, which drives technological progress. Inventions that were considered revolutionary yesterday serve everyday needs in the 21st century: a microwave oven, a mobile phone, an 8-bit home computer. It depends on the programmer-scientist what peaks science will reach today and which of them will enter every house tomorrow.\nIn the hands of the programmer-scientist are the tools not only to develop the industry, but also to improve the overall quality of life. Such a specialist increases the prognostic function of humanity, helping to predict and prevent climate, financial, and humanitarian disasters.\nWhere to learn programming You can learn programming anytime, anywhere. Specialized literature, face-to-face training, Internet sites - all these resources are able to provide a novice programmer with a knowledge base sufficient for independent creativity and advanced training, including in line with scientific development.\n","date":1653696000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653696000,"objectID":"78abcd895843b958198601b9d6769b93","permalink":"https://aaandrievskaya.github.io/post/scientific-programming-languages/","publishdate":"2022-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/scientific-programming-languages/","section":"post","summary":"Programming is a science that will be useful for those who decide to link their careers with computer development","tags":["Work","Programming","Science"],"title":"Scientific programming languages","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction The problem of the reliability of personal identification in modern conditions worries many authors, since the number of participants in electronic interaction in the modern world is steadily growing. Authentication is the basis for building a trusting relationship between the parties when they interact through open communication channels, in connection with which the role of authentication of participants becomes significant.\nAuthentication is the process of determining whether someone (or something) is who he or she is pretending to be. In the context of IT processes, this means that the credentials provided by the person requesting access to the resource are compared with the data held by the resource. If the information matches, the user is granted access. As a rule, authentication processes are associated with the following tasks: to provide authorized access, to establish trust relationships during remote access, to establish (identify) the identity of the owner of an electronic signature, etc.\n1. Password authentication prototypes 1.1 Voice passwords Speech passwords have found their application due to the absence of any additional means in establishing the belonging of a certain person to a specific group of people. For example, in the medieval Spanish army there were cases when, at nightfall, nervous soldiers accidentally killed one of their own, mistaking them for an enemy. The military leaders soon devised a remedy for this problem: every day they chose a word that, in the form of a secret signal, would serve so that the soldiers of the same group could recognize each other.\nThis system played an indispensable role during the Civil War and the Great Patriotic War, as evidenced by numerous historical documents. The password and recall were set, among other things, for conducting telegraph negotiations along the line of military communications.\nPasswords and reviews are often used in undercover intelligence. They are predetermined phrases by which you can recognize a scout or agent. Here, the verbal password is proof that the scout (agent) was confronted by exactly the person with whom the other could meet and work.\nThe password and the answer to it can be real. In this case, those who meet may have with them objects predetermined and known only to them, for example, combs, coins, banknotes, which may be the same or, on the contrary, different. In this case, the real password can be independent or supplement the verbal password.\n1.2 Castles A lock is a mechanical, electrical or electronic device that limits the possibility of unauthorized use of something.\nThe idea of ​​locks and keys to them arose with the advent of private property, when people began to think about how to protect it from outside encroachment.\nThe presence of a shared key made the locks less secure, as it reduced the degree of security. Special combination locks, opened by typing letters or numbers on rotating disks, appeared in Europe in the 17th century. The use of the lock code was the prototype for the introduction of the modern password, and the selection of the code was difficult. So, of interest is the Eureka combination lock, patented in the USA in 1862, in which, due to the large number of different letters and numbers, the number of possible combinations on the lock was 1,073,741,824.\nDrawing an analogy between a lock code and a computer password, the former has advantages and disadvantages similar to a modern password. The advantages include the absence of a key that can be lost and which an attacker can copy in the absence of the owner; the ability to quickly change the code. The disadvantages are as follows: the code can be forgotten, but writing it down increases the likelihood that an outsider will recognize the code; the code can be peeped when entering; often dates of birth, addresses, well-known numbers are used as codes, which simplifies the selection of the code.\nA variation of the combination lock is an electronic lock. An electronic lock is a high-tech device controlled by microprocessors and used to lock doors. In the presence of an electronic lock, a decision on the access of persons to the premises is made on the basis of signals from various sensors: magnetic card readers, barcodes, contact memory sensors, biometric sensors, dial pads, combinatorial fluorescent molecular sensors, remote control, etc. In the future, electronic locks could compete with molecular locks, which have a sensor that responds not to a set of electrical signals from a keyboard or a reader, but to a set of chemicals.\n2. Password authentication The advent of computers led to the need to protect the information stored in them, as well as the creation of access control mechanisms to it, the main component of which was user authentication, one of which is password. Fernando Corbato, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is considered the inventor of computer passwords.

But the basic elements from the list below are supported in all standards.\nText selection This text will be italicized This text will be italic (italic)\nThis text will be bold This text will be bold\nYou can insert one type into another\nTitles ‘# This is the largest heading, it turns into an  tag ‘##  ‘###  ‘####  ‘#####  ‘###### \nIn Markdown, headings are written without the symbol \u0026#39;\nLinks https://hexlet.io - the text of a simple link will become a clickable link automatically You can make any text a link:\nThis is a Hexlet link\nQuote  That’s a wise quote wise man.\n Pictures    The code To highlight code (or any unformatted text), special characters are used - back ticks: `\nSometimes you need to add a piece of code function(12); to a regular line of text. And sometimes you need to insert a whole block of code:\nconst func = (num) =\u0026gt; { if (num \u0026gt; 0) { return num - 1; } return num + 1; }; Lists Unnumbered list:\n Paragraph *One more item  Subparagraph Another sub-item Numbered list:     Item One more point Subparagraph One more subparagraph You can use any numbers in a numbered list - it doesn’t matter. When converted to HTML or another format, the numbers will become correct and consistent (1, 2, 3, etc.).

On Wednesday, I was in a hurry to go home, as it was already quite late. I stumbled and twisted my leg. It didn’t hurt me and at that moment I didn’t attach any importance to it. However, already on Friday, the leg was very swollen and it was impossible to walk. I had to go to the emergency room and explain the situation. Of course, there was no talk of attending a university. I was issued a sick leave and now I’m staying at home, away from all the interesting events…\nHowever, perhaps this is for the best. During this time, I will miss all my friends enough and it will be doubly joyful to see them again! Also, from now on, I will be much more accurate, because I no longer want to experience this for myself.\nNow my leg already feels much better and is gradually disappearing, so you don’t have to worry, I will definitely return to the ranks !!!)\nMy social networks  VK Instagram  ","date":1651881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651881600,"objectID":"b72527a41af8b6617f7ede6804039cb0","permalink":"https://aaandrievskaya.github.io/post/%D0%BDow-was-my-week/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/%D0%BDow-was-my-week/","section":"post","summary":"Hello everyone 👋 This post, although the first one, will tell you about the failures in my life.

General concepts Version control systems (VCS) are used when several people work on the same project. Usually the main project tree is stored in the local or a remote repository to which access is configured for project members. At making changes to the content of the project, the version control system allows them to fix, combine changes made by different project participants, rollback to any earlier version of the project, if required. Classical version control systems use a centralized model, assuming a single repository for storing files. Most of the version control functions are performed by a dedicated server. The project participant (user) before starting work through certain command gets the version of files it needs. After making changes, the user commits the new version to the repository. This does not remove previous versions. from the central repository and you can return to them at any time. The server can save not the full version of the changed files, but produce the so-called delta compression - save only changes between successive versions, which allows you to reduce the amount of stored data. Version control systems support traceability and resolution conflicts that may arise when several people work on one file. You can merge (merge) the changes made by different participants (automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, undo the changes altogether or lock files for modification. Depending on the settings, blocking is not allows other users to get a working copy or prevents modification working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file. Version control systems can also provide additional, more flexible functionality. For example, they can support working with multiple versions of the same file, keeping a common history of changes up to the branch point. versions and each branch’s own change histories. In addition, it is usually available information about which of the participants, when and what changes were made. Usually this kind of information is stored in the change log, access to which can be restricted. Unlike classical ones, in distributed version control systems, the central the repository is optional. Among the classic VCS, CVS, Subversion are the most famous, and among the distributed ones - Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. The principles of their work are similar, they differ mainly the syntax of the commands used in the work.\nBasic git commands The most commonly used git commands are: – creating the main repository tree:\n1 git init\n– receiving updates (changes) of the current tree from the central repository:\n1 git pull\n– sending all the changes made to the local tree to the central repository:\n1 git push\n– view the list of changed files in the current directory:\n1 git status\n– view current changes:\n1 git diff\n– saving current changes: – add all modified and/or created files and/or directories:\n1 git add .\n– add specific modified and/or created files and/or directories:\n1 git add filenames\n– delete a file and/or directory from the repository index (in this case, the file and/or directory remains in the local directory):\n1 git rm filenames\n– saving the added changes: – save all added changes and all modified files:\n1 git commit -am ‘Commit description’\n save the added changes with a comment through the built-in editor:  1 git commit\n– creating a new branch based on the current one:\n1 git checkout -b branchname\n switch to some branch:  1 git checkout branch_name\n(when you switch to a branch that is not yet in the local repository, it will be created and linked to the remote) – pushing changes of a specific branch to the central repository:\n1 git push origin branchname\n– merge the branch with the current tree:\n1 git merge –no-ff branchname\n deleting a branch: – deleting a local branch already merged with the main tree:  1 git branch -d branchname\n forced deletion of the local branch:  1 git branch -D branchname\n– deleting a branch from the central repository:\n1 git push origin :branchname\nStandard Operating Procedures for a Central Repository The work of the user with his branch begins with checking and receiving changes from the central repository (at the same time, to the local tree before starting this procedure should not be changed):\n1 git checkout master 2 git-pull 3 git checkout -b branchname\nYou can then make changes in the local tree and/or branch. After the completion of making some change to the files and / or directories of the project you need to place them in the central repository. To do this, you need to check, which files have changed so far:\n1 git status\nand, if necessary, delete unnecessary files that we do not want to send to the central repository. Then it is useful to review the text of the changes for compliance with the rules for maintaining clean commits:\n1 git diff\nIf some files should not be included in the commit, then we mark only those …","date":1651881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651881600,"objectID":"97164bfe184b400c3adb26bd96db98ad","permalink":"https://aaandrievskaya.github.io/post/version-control.-git/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/version-control.-git/","section":"post","summary":"We will study the ideology and application of version control tools.
