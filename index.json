Here the entire scientific apparatus is set out, which guides the researcher, performing search work. On its basis, the supervisor analyzes the quality of the performance of the essay, term paper or thesis and evaluates: how deeply the relevance of the topic is realized and understood, whether the goal has been achieved, whether the research methods have been chosen correctly and whether they have been used correctly, etc.\nThe composition of the Introduction is a description of the scientific apparatus, which depends on what kind of work is being done. If an abstract is being written, then the Introduction will describe the relevance of the topic, the purpose of the abstract, the subject and methods of research. If this is a term paper, then the Introduction, in addition to those components that are included in the abstract, will also include a description of the object and objectives of the study. The thesis describes the entire scientific apparatus. So the student, from work to work, gradually masters the technology of designing scientific research in forms accessible to him.\nThe volume of the Introduction is approximately 1/10 of the entire volume of the work, that is, the specific text of the abstract, term paper or thesis. Place of Introduction - it is located immediately after the Table of Contents before the main part.\nRequirements for writing an Introduction:\na) Introduction is printed on separate pages;\nb) it is not numbered either in the Table of Contents or in the text, but goes as an independent part of the work;\nc) all components of the scientific apparatus are highlighted in type or underlined;\nd) each component is written from a new line.\nFor example:\nThe relevance of the study is determined by the fact that …;\nThe purpose of the study is to develop a set of methods …;\nThe subject of the study is the methods of educating observation…\nWhen writing the Introduction, we recommend paying special attention to the relevance of the research topic. This is, in fact, a patent research work to find a state or regional order for your topic, to determine the place of the topic in the scientific world, in relation to practice.\nBe vigilant - reading the Introduction begins the evaluation of your work. Everyone reads the introduction, especially opponents. By its quality, they judge all the work, the level of professional training, responsibility, the ability to design their work and carry it out thoughtfully, and many other qualities of a specialist.\nThe main part “The main part” is the conditional name of the description of the entire study, that is, the substantive part of the abstract, term paper or thesis.

General concepts Version control systems (VCS) are used when several people work on the same project. Usually the main project tree is stored in the local or a remote repository to which access is configured for project members. At making changes to the content of the project, the version control system allows them to fix, combine changes made by different project participants, rollback to any earlier version of the project, if required. Classical version control systems use a centralized model, assuming a single repository for storing files. Most of the version control functions are performed by a dedicated server. The project participant (user) before starting work through certain command gets the version of files it needs. After making changes, the user commits the new version to the repository. This does not remove previous versions. from the central repository and you can return to them at any time. The server can save not the full version of the changed files, but produce the so-called delta compression - save only changes between successive versions, which allows you to reduce the amount of stored data. Version control systems support traceability and resolution conflicts that may arise when several people work on one file. You can merge (merge) the changes made by different participants (automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, undo the changes altogether or lock files for modification. Depending on the settings, blocking is not allows other users to get a working copy or prevents modification working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file. Version control systems can also provide additional, more flexible functionality. For example, they can support working with multiple versions of the same file, keeping a common history of changes up to the branch point. versions and each branch’s own change histories. In addition, it is usually available information about which of the participants, when and what changes were made. Usually this kind of information is stored in the change log, access to which can be restricted. Unlike classical ones, in distributed version control systems, the central the repository is optional. Among the classic VCS, CVS, Subversion are the most famous, and among the distributed ones - Git, Bazaar, Mercurial. The principles of their work are similar, they differ mainly the syntax of the commands used in the work.\nBasic git commands The most commonly used git commands are: – creating the main repository tree:\n1 git init\n– receiving updates (changes) of the current tree from the central repository:\n1 git pull\n– sending all the changes made to the local tree to the central repository:\n1 git push\n– view the list of changed files in the current directory:\n1 git status\n– view current changes:\n1 git diff\n– saving current changes: – add all modified and/or created files and/or directories:\n1 git add .\n– add specific modified and/or created files and/or directories:\n1 git add filenames\n– delete a file and/or directory from the repository index (in this case, the file and/or directory remains in the local directory):\n1 git rm filenames\n– saving the added changes: – save all added changes and all modified files:\n1 git commit -am ‘Commit description’\n save the added changes with a comment through the built-in editor:  1 git commit\n– creating a new branch based on the current one:\n1 git checkout -b branchname\n switch to some branch:  1 git checkout branch_name\n(when you switch to a branch that is not yet in the local repository, it will be created and linked to the remote) – pushing changes of a specific branch to the central repository:\n1 git push origin branchname\n– merge the branch with the current tree:\n1 git merge –no-ff branchname\n deleting a branch: – deleting a local branch already merged with the main tree:  1 git branch -d branchname\n forced deletion of the local branch:  1 git branch -D branchname\n– deleting a branch from the central repository:\n1 git push origin :branchname\nStandard Operating Procedures for a Central Repository The work of the user with his branch begins with checking and receiving changes from the central repository (at the same time, to the local tree before starting this procedure should not be changed):\n1 git checkout master 2 git-pull 3 git checkout -b branchname\nYou can then make changes in the local tree and/or branch. After the completion of making some change to the files and / or directories of the project you need to place them in the central repository. To do this, you need to check, which files have changed so far:\n1 git status\nand, if necessary, delete unnecessary files that we do not want to send to the central repository. Then it is useful to review the text of the changes for compliance with the rules for maintaining clean commits:\n1 git diff\nIf some files should not be included in the commit, then we mark only those …","date":1651881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651881600,"objectID":"97164bfe184b400c3adb26bd96db98ad","permalink":"https://aaandrievskaya.github.io/post/version-control.-git/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/version-control.-git/","section":"post","summary":"We will study the ideology and application of version control tools.
